      	Advances in robotics and machine learning will transform the food industry, just as they are changing many industries now. In the not-too-distant future, the meals we eat will be prepared - chopped, cooked, and served - with the help of  robots. This will save people - and businesses - time, lower costs, improve and standardise quality, and reduce food waste.

				We are using robotic technology to create a ‘chef robot’ that can help in cooking any cuisine or any dish in the world. This could be used for businesses (dark-kitchens, restaurants, factories), or at home, where people will be able to eat restaurant quality meals at a fraction of the cost.
