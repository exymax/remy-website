          <div className="text">
            We believe that the advances in robotics and machine learning will transform the food industry, just as they are changing many industries now. In the not-too-distant future, the meals we eat will be prepared - chopped, cooked, and served - with the help of robots. This will save people - and businesses - time, lower costs, improve and standardise quality, and reduce food waste.

            Remy Robotics is the latest project from Kinetik, a technology investment group with companies at the cutting edge of Electric Vehicles (ARRIVAL), Robofacturing (TRA Robotics) and Autonomous Vehicles (Roborace). Kinetik has offices in London, Los Angeles,
            and Moscow, while Remy Robotics is located in Barcelona with some engineering functions in Moscow. For Remy Robotics, we have brought together talented specialists in the fields of robotics and machine learning from all over the world.

          <div className="text">
            We are using robotic technology to take the routine and inefficiency out of cooking, creating a ‘chef robot’ that can help in cooking any cuisine or any dish in the world. This could be used for businesses (factories, restaurants, delivery-only), or at home, where people will be
            able to eat restaurant quality meals at a fraction of the cost.
